            "text": "I think the American suburban yard may be equally responsible with agriculture for a lot of this in the US.  The use of herbicides and pesticides is completely unregulated.  Additionally lawns are an unnecessary waste of time for most people and have a large carbon footprint.  I had a small native plant yard that attracted hundreds of pollinators and arachnids.  I was treated like and criminal forced to cut most of it down.  I still get a fair amount of terrestrial arthropods but not as much.<p>It sickens me when I see workers with those sprayer packs or trucks that look like small chemical plants.<p>Before I decided to comment I submitted my write up, if you are interested you can read that you can read here:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elegantcoding.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;reimagining-suburban-yard-to-reverse.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elegantcoding.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;reimagining-suburban-ya...</a><p>Edit:  I did want to mention that I definitely seen a massive decline in butterflies and moths over the last 15 years.<p>Update:  I quoted 40 million acres below, which is for turf grass which probably includes athletic fields.  I am not against everyone having a lawn or athletic fields.  I do think people should be able to cultivate their native environment on their suburban property and this should be encouraged and even incentivized.  My neighbor’s kids play in their backyard, so they have a need for it. Of course a non herbicide non monoculture lawn should work ok too. That’s what I grew up with.<p>Also I think that gas powered devices need to be replaced with electric devices.  I think something like 17 million gallons of fuel are spilled alone in relation to lawn maintenance.<p>The thing that scares me is the normality of spraying for mosquitoes.  In my area it’s the invasive Aedes mosquito species, the native species are a lot less aggressive.  Also with some of these other very scary invasive species like the marmorated stink bug, ash borer, lantern fly, that new Asian tick, etc. Are we going to end up using more and more insecticides and subsequently kill more and more of our native fauna?",

Three major (to us) accidents and a bunch of lesser material releases have had minimal impact to the earth in the big scheme of things.<p>Of far greater harm is our extraction and burning of fossil.  The California methane leak, all of the various oil spills, and now shale drilling all have substantial, long term harm we can measure in the climate and the local ecologies.<p>Obviously we&#x27;d prefer greener power if possible, but nuclear power appears by far the lesser evil than all the fossil activity.",

Then out of the blue we got a call for a meeting with 3-4 very senior managers at a local irish bar.<p>They paid for dinner and tried to explain how the business would be extremely lucrative.  we would all see major bonuses, we could hire more workers, and grow the business faster than just large truck repair.  It took 3 very emotional hours, but we eventually talked down a handful of people from making a very wrong decision.<p>for a week after, we were all sort of stunned that it actually worked at all.

Over the past year, we&#x27;ve grown our community of active job seekers enormously, landed jobs for many, many deserving men and women and achieved profitability.<p>Up until now, company technology has been outsourced, but we&#x27;ve outgrown this, and need someone up for the challenge of building the next generation job board while saving lots of lives.<p>Given the unique nature of our users (the formerly incarcerated) who access the Internet primarily through their phone, we need someone who has a strong UI&#x2F;UX eye. We do lots of fairly sophisticated marketing and generate lots of data, so there must be an interest there as well. And as we are a decidedly tech-challenged team, we need someone can take ownership of this important part of our business while being very communicative (and patient).<p>In exchange, we offer a market salary, lots of equity, a very collegial, passionate team, and a chance to work on something that actually matters. We&#x27;re seeking double bottom line returns: build a very profitable, successful business while doing massive social good.<p>We&#x27;re currently based in SF but are planning to move the company to LA beginning of next year.

These guys have no idea how this stuff works or its impact on the greater environment.  They need to use it because plants and insects are becoming resistant to the old stuff and farms are in the business to make money.  Externalities be damned.<p>Suburban lawn care has been going on for decades, using largely the same approach it always has.  Mainly fertilizers applied once or twice a year if you bother to care.  Broadleaf weed killers, maybe grub killer.  The primary way to getting a nice lawn, though, is to overseed so often you choke out weeds.  On the other side of the coin, agriculture is engaging in a broad spectrum application of herbacides, pesticides, etc with new formulas coming all the time.  At an insane scale.<p>There is no comparison to yards.  It&#x27;s agriculture.",

Watson may beat us at Jeopardy, but we are convinced we have something AI will always lack:  We are agents in the world, whose decisions, choices, actions are made meaningful by the content of the belief&#x2F;desire pairings that bring them about. But what if the theory of mind that underwrites our distinctiveness is build on sand, is just another useful illusion foisted upon us by the Darwinian processes that got us here? Then it will turn out that neuroscience is a far greater threat to human distinctiveness than AI will ever be.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how someone could believe that AI would always lack these things without also believing in some form of essentialism, basically believing that major parts of the human experience are &quot;magic&quot; somehow rather than derived from physical processes.<p>Anyway the author&#x27;s major concern seems to be that neuroscience has demonstrated that desires and beliefs are not directly real in the same way that, say, your brain is a particular collection of atoms restricted to the physical confines of your skull. I suppose this could be very disturbing if you have the sense that your life is significantly more meaningful if all of your desires and beliefs are as real as the ground you walk on rather than being some illusory projection of the brain.<p>The problem actually arises from the associations that we have with the word &quot;illusion&quot;. As soon as we start to think of our beliefs and desires as &quot;illusions&quot;, it&#x27;s natural to leap to terms like &quot;fake&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, &quot;worthless&quot;, &quot;deceit&quot;, and so on. In other words, there are all kinds of negative connotations that we associate with the word &quot;illusion&quot;, so when we use that to describe core parts of what we think of as the human experience, it makes us feel bad.<p>But this is simply a limit of our language: what <i>are</i> the illusions of &quot;beliefs&quot; and &quot;desires&quot; anyway? Desires correspond to our experiences; if we want food, that corresponds to a very real physical state of our physical bodies. Beliefs are a lot shakier because they tend to be be built on complex layers of ideas, but they correspond to physical reality as well, whether or not they&#x27;re particularly accurate.

Why do we do it? And notice it’s not only us relatively wealthy people, in terms of global wealth, who are doing it - it’s everybody that we know of. Every human group we know of is spending a lot of their time – in fact almost all of their surplus time and energy – is spent in the act of stylising things and enjoying other people’s stylisations of things. So my question is, what is it for? In fact, my friend Danny Hillus, who’s a scientist, was asked by a well-known science website, along with about 300 other scientists, he was asked what is the most interesting scientific question at the moment? A lot of the other people replied with things about the cosmological constant and Ryman’s Hypothesis and all these very complicated things. And his question was very simple: he said why do we like music? And if you start thinking about that, that is really one of the most mysterious things you can imagine. Why do we even have an interest in music? Why do we have preferences? Why do we like this song better than that one? Why do we like this Beethoven sonata better than that Beethoven sonata? Why do we like this performance of that same sonata better than that other performance? We had very fine distinctions about things that we prefer, aesthetic things. And, yet, none of it seems to have much to do with functionalism, with staying alive and certainly not with industries I would say.&quot; - Brian Eno<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;mediacentre&#x2F;speeches&#x2F;2015&#x2F;bbc-music-john-peel-lecture\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;mediacentre&#x2F;speeches&#x2F;2015&#x2F;bbc-music-jo...</a>",

Both can be critical depending on the mission.<p>Unfortunately, &quot;subjective&quot; is often used as a dirty word especially around here where some folks even claim to prefer html stripped of all styling. As you pointed out, there is a lot of thought and sweat that goes into the creation of a typeface. The artistic aspects deserve respect and attention not just from the practitioners but also from their users.<p>I think it&#x27;s actually a good thing that there&#x27;s a proliferation of typefaces. If a large company, wanting to avoid millions of dollars in fees to license a typeface, can pay a designer to create a new one that&#x27;s a good thing. Even if the typeface is created for reasons of brand vanity, it puts someone to work and helps to further the development of typography in general.",

            "text": "This year I happen to work for a client that licenses all of their brand fonts. Licensed and pay-per-use fonts have easily and quickly worked their way up to the top 5 most agitating things to work with.<p>- They track use by embedding a link to the third party font provider, which does a 302 redirect to a file on your server that requires revalidation every load. So while you host the actual file delivered to the client, you can&#x27;t optimize away the time added by that needless redirect on every single pageload[1].<p>- On some clients, invalidating that original link will also invalidate the cache for the destination of the 302 redirect, so the user is forced to truly redownload the font each pageload.<p>- Automated bot traffic, whether benign, malicious, search engines, or anything at all, becomes very expensive. A flood of scrapers hitting your site shifts from a minor nuisance to a very big deal. Something that your infrastructure can absorb without a hiccup can easily rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of font usage costs. You can put security measures in place to prevent some of this, but at the risk of adding friction to legitimate traffic. And don&#x27;t <i>wan&#x27;t</i> to stop legitimate bots like social media crawlers and search engines. So you can either leave the risk open ended or &quot;fail open&quot; where, rather than blocking a visit, you selectively decide when to include the custom font and when not to. Cloudflare&#x27;s SSE[2] comes in handy for this, combined with dynamic inclusion in the server side code to exclude it from being served to legitimate bots like Googlebot which don&#x27;t need the custom font. I&#x27;ve also experimented recently with using Cloudflare Workers for handling that process and abstracting it completely from the original site. While Cloudflare Workers also have variable pricing based on usage, it&#x27;s over an order of magnitude cheaper than the usage-based pricing of the font itself, and well worth the cost.<p>- Maintaining that added complexity, purely to cap the risk of the pay-per-view pricing model of the font, adds a needless amount of friction to the website management and development process.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smugmug.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smugmug.com&#x2F;</a> is a site that shows this workflow. They load a font file from cloud.typography.com which 302 redirects to the <i>real</i> font file hosted on Smugmug&#x27;s CDN. While the response is usually fairly quick, I&#x27;ve seen inconsistent response times from the third party providers. And the fact that in some scenarios the must-revalidate flag from the 302 response causes the cache setting from the destination font file to be ignored as well, making it get downloaded every single pageview.<p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.cloudflare.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;200170036-What-does-Server-Side-Excludes-SSE-do-\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.cloudflare.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;200170036-W...</a>",
