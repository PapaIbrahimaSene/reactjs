Additionally lawns are an unnecessary waste of time for most people and have a large carbon footprint.  I had a small native plant yard that attracted hundreds of pollinators and arachnids.  I was treated like and criminal forced to cut most of it down.  I still get a fair amount of terrestrial arthropods but not as much.<p>It sickens me when I see workers with those sprayer packs or trucks that look like small chemical plants.<p>Before I decided to comment I submitted my write up, if you are interested you can read that you can read here:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elegantcoding.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;reimagining-suburban-yard-to-reverse.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elegantcoding.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;reimagining-suburban-ya...</a><p>Edit:  I did want to mention that I definitely seen a massive decline in butterflies and moths over the last 15 years.<p>Update:  I quoted 40 million acres below, which is for turf grass which probably includes athletic fields.  I am not against everyone having a lawn or athletic fields.  I do think people should be able to cultivate their native environment on their suburban property and this should be encouraged and even incentivized.  My neighbor’s kids play in their backyard, so they have a need for it. Of course a non herbicide non monoculture lawn should work ok too. That’s what I grew up with.<p>Also I think that gas powered devices need to be replaced with electric devices.  I think something like 17 million gallons of fuel are spilled alone in relation to lawn maintenance.<p>The thing that scares me is the normality of spraying for mosquitoes.  In my area it’s the invasive Aedes mosquito species, the native species are a lot less aggressive.  Also with some of these other very scary invasive species like the marmorated stink bug, ash borer, lantern fly, that new Asian tick, etc. Are we going to end up using more and more insecticides and subsequently kill more and more of our native fauna?",

There are vast commercial and other interests involved.<p>&gt; Because it&#x27;s so hard to get permission to build new reactors, older reactors were used for longer<p>Because it was much easier and cost effective, older reactor lifetimes were extended.

We do things like fire trucks and police cars, but we were working on a new regional idea as a &quot;service center&quot; for municipalities that purchased MRAP combat vehicles for their police departments.  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MRAP\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MRAP</a><p>We all, especially the veterans I work with, hated this idea.  MRAP&#x27;s are for combat, not police work, and have a dangerous propensity to roll over in city streets or escalate already violent situations.  14 of us sent a signed letter to the owner and senior management detailing our major concerns and heard nothing back for about a month.  Then out of the blue we got a call for a meeting with 3-4 very senior managers at a local irish bar.<p>They paid for dinner and tried to explain how the business would be extremely lucrative.  we would all see major bonuses, we could hire more workers, and grow the business faster than just large truck repair.  It took 3 very emotional hours, but we eventually talked down a handful of people from making a very wrong decision.<p>for a week after, we were all sort of stunned that it actually worked at all.

Watson may beat us at Jeopardy, but we are convinced we have something AI will always lack:  We are agents in the world, whose decisions, choices, actions are made meaningful by the content of the belief&#x2F;desire pairings that bring them about. But what if the theory of mind that underwrites our distinctiveness is build on sand, is just another useful illusion foisted upon us by the Darwinian processes that got us here? Then it will turn out that neuroscience is a far greater threat to human distinctiveness than AI will ever be.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how someone could believe that AI would always lack these things without also believing in some form of essentialism, basically believing that major parts of the human experience are &quot;magic&quot; somehow rather than derived from physical processes.<p>Anyway the author&#x27;s major concern seems to be that neuroscience has demonstrated that desires and beliefs are not directly real in the same way that, say, your brain is a particular collection of atoms restricted to the physical confines of your skull. I suppose this could be very disturbing if you have the sense that your life is significantly more meaningful if all of your desires and beliefs are as real as the ground you walk on rather than being some illusory projection of the brain.<p>The problem actually arises from the associations that we have with the word &quot;illusion&quot;. As soon as we start to think of our beliefs and desires as &quot;illusions&quot;, it&#x27;s natural to leap to terms like &quot;fake&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, &quot;worthless&quot;, &quot;deceit&quot;, and so on. In other words, there are all kinds of negative connotations that we associate with the word &quot;illusion&quot;, so when we use that to describe core parts of what we think of as the human experience, it makes us feel bad.<p>But this is simply a limit of our language: what <i>are</i> the illusions of &quot;beliefs&quot; and &quot;desires&quot; anyway? Desires correspond to our experiences; if we want food, that corresponds to a very real physical state of our physical bodies. Beliefs are a lot shakier because they tend to be be built on complex layers of ideas, but they correspond to physical reality as well, whether or not they&#x27;re particularly accurate. So these things are very useful and important despite being &quot;illusions&quot;. And there&#x27;s a huge difference between these &quot;illusions&quot; and direct falsehoods. So I think the real limitation here is that we don&#x27;t have language that&#x27;s particularly well adapted to discussing and thinking about these things.",

        "text": "This is one of those times where as a working creative that frequently reads Hacker News I straight up face palm.<p>I have to imagine a lot of these commenters would say the same  in regards to any sort of subjective artistic choice that isn&#x27;t purely optimized for efficiency.<p>I would like to leave you with a quote by Briano Eno from a really good lecture he gave several years ago that I hope can provide a jumping off point for alternate ways to think about style, and why I think y&#x27;all are asking the wrong questions.<p>&quot;So the first question is, why is any of that important? Why do we do it? And notice it’s not only us relatively wealthy people, in terms of global wealth, who are doing it - it’s everybody that we know of. Every human group we know of is spending a lot of their time – in fact almost all of their surplus time and energy – is spent in the act of stylising things and enjoying other people’s stylisations of things. So my question is, what is it for? In fact, my friend Danny Hillus, who’s a scientist, was asked by a well-known science website, along with about 300 other scientists, he was asked what is the most interesting scientific question at the moment? A lot of the other people replied with things about the cosmological constant and Ryman’s Hypothesis and all these very complicated things. And his question was very simple: he said why do we like music? And if you start thinking about that, that is really one of the most mysterious things you can imagine. Why do we even have an interest in music? Why do we have preferences? Why do we like this song better than that one? Why do we like this Beethoven sonata better than that Beethoven sonata? Why do we like this performance of that same sonata better than that other performance? We had very fine distinctions about things that we prefer, aesthetic things. And, yet, none of it seems to have much to do with functionalism, with staying alive and certainly not with industries I would say.&quot; - Brian Eno<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;mediacentre&#x2F;speeches&#x2F;2015&#x2F;bbc-music-john-peel-lecture\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;mediacentre&#x2F;speeches&#x2F;2015&#x2F;bbc-music-jo...</a>",
